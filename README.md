The solar powered vehicle is designed, keeping in view the difficulties faced by the physical challenged in the society and to relieve the ever-increasing demand for the conventional sources of fuel. This project focuses on creating an eco-friendly environment as well as to serve as a simpler mode of transportation for the physically challenged in the society. The conventional solar vehicles are purely driven by a single battery. Whereas this design houses two batteries, wherein one will act as an active one that drives the system and the other battery will be used as an auxiliary. The multiple battery charging technique using Arduino microcontroller is implemented in this project, which governs the parallel charging of the batteries used. Also, manual hand pedal driving is provisioned so as to run the vehicle even when there is any kind of battery outage
